ContinuedLearning is an intellectual endeavour that encourages people of all walks and backgrounds to record the tidbits of information that they learn on a daily basis.

By recording something you wish to remember at the end of the day, you are helping your brain actively appropriate this piece of information as knowledge.

Sharing your ContinuedLearning information with others makes you accountable in a sense, and also provides a great way to discover new information, as expressed by someone who's just learned it.

The process is simple : at the end of the day, write down everything you feel you've learned. 
It can be in one big file that you append to, or start a new text file for each day.  

The format is really not important.

If you don't remember something that you learned, take 5 minutes to go back and lookup the information, then summarize it in your own words. Don't copy-paste information directly from another source : it's the act of explaining something in your own words that helps you actually learn it.
